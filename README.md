# Meetups

Looking to organize a meetup with the [Go Language NYC](https://www.meetup.com/golanguagenewyork/) group? This is the repository for you.

All meetups are given by the community, for the community.

## Scheduling a talk
Scheduling a talk starts off by opening up a [New Issue](https://github.com/nycgolang/meetups/issues/new) with the details for your talk. All experience levels in public speaking and Go programming are welcome to give a talk!

Once the talk has been approved (mainly securing a venue, budget for food, and support staff) we will post an event on Meetup.com for sign-ups.

## Code of Conduct
Go Language NYC officially adopts the Go Code of Conduct (https://golang.org/conduct). Harassment, bullying, and discrimination are unacceptable here and if you witness or experience those or other harmful behaviors, please let the organizers know.
